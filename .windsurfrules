- when using icons, always use fontawesome's icons
    - use only dualtone solid icons (<i class="fa-duotone fa-regular fa-*"></i>);
    - classic regular icons (<i class="fa-regular fa-*"></i>); or
    - brand icons (<i class="fa-brands fa-*"></i>).
- you will prefer non colored icons.
- always consider that you need to create colors for the light and dark themes
    - use the css variables defined in the css.css file
- always respect types in the "global.ts" file, keep them updated with changes to the models you make
- prefer using <script setup lang="ts"> instead of <script lang="ts">, expecially on new files
- whenever a configuration is added to the settings page, it should be saved in the settings store on the "src/store/settings.ts" file
- add analytics events to the "src/services/analytics.ts" file for every new feature added to the app
- If the user has explicitly set something at the task level, it should be prioratized over the project level settings, if the user explicitly set a project level setting, it should be propratized over the global level setting
